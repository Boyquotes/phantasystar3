Cleanup the project UI to start fresh.

Goals:

- The UI should be similiar to Phantasy Star Online 2, but bigger for mobile users.

To-do:

- [ ] Apply Roboto font everywhere in the default theme.
- [ ] Reset the pause button appearance.
- [ ] Update the default theme.
- [ ] Update `ps3_default_panel`.
- [ ] Create `ps3_default_panel_with_header`.
- [ ] UI should be heavily dependent on popup and collapse signals and express dependent panels in a concise way.
